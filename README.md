# In Class Lab 1 - 4/3/19

In this lab you will get practice using git, GitHub, and writing some simple C code.  

Instructions:
1. You should be completing this assignment in luke.cs.spu.edu, where git is already installed.
2. Once you accept the assignment, you get a public repository with the starter code (future assignments will be private).
3. You need to clone *your* copy of the public repository.  To do so, at a command prompt type: "git clone *link to your repo*"   It should be something like: "git clone https://github.com/osp19/in_class_lab_1_username" (where username is your GitHub username). *Do not clone this link, which is the assignment parent repo, or you will not be able to push your code: https://github.com/osp19/in_class_lab_1.git*
4. Once you have cloned the repository, you can start editing the code.  Write your solution using an editor of your choice.  Test your code by compiling and running it.
5. Normally, you will make changes to your code and do the following add/commit/push step in small increments.  For example, implement and test a function, then add/commmit/push your work to GitHub.  This lets you track your progress *and* have a back-up of your work.
6. For this assignment, you will write a complete solution and do add/commit/push twice.  What you should do is convert the code from using execvp to use execlp. After writing your code, do the following:
  * git add fork.c
  * git commit fork.c
  * If needed, follow the instructions to setup your name and e-mail address.
  * The commit command requires you to type a commit message.  It should be meaningful, but brief.  For example "Converted between versions of exec (execvp to execlp)"
  * git push
  * (You will be asked for username/password to GitHub)

7. Check to make sure your changes got sent to the GitHub repository.  If they did, make one more change to your code on luke.  For example, add a comment header at the top with your name, date, etc.
8. Follow the previous steps to add/commit/push your code to GitHub.
9. You will not turn anything in to Canvas.  The last commit at the due date/time will be snapshotted for grading.
